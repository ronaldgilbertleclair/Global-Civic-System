# Why Obvious Solutions Are Hard to Adopt

It often feels strange to say this out loud, but many of the world’s most serious problems are not technically hard to solve.

We already produce enough food.  
We already know how to house people.  
We already understand how to prevent most disease.  
We already have the tools to reduce war, pollution, and extreme poverty.

When these facts are stated plainly, they don’t sound revolutionary. They sound obvious.

So why do the problems persist?

The answer is uncomfortable: **agreement is not the same as permission**.

Most global suffering is not caused by a lack of solutions. It is caused by systems that prevent people from coordinating freely around those solutions. Harm is widespread, but control over resources, decision-making, and communication is concentrated. Those most affected often lack the time, safety, or stability needed to act collectively, even when they agree on what should change.

This is not because people are cruel or ignorant. It is because fear shapes behavior at every level.

People struggling to survive fear losing what little they have.  
People who are stable fear disruption.  
People in power fear loss of control.  
Institutions fear irrelevance.

These fears persist even when change would benefit everyone in the long run.

As a result, systems don’t give way simply because better ideas exist. They persist through habit, dependency, legitimacy, and the absence of trusted alternatives. A solution can be logically simple and socially complex at the same time.

This is why proposals for more cooperative, humane systems often feel “too obvious” and yet somehow unreachable. They don’t fail because they are wrong. They fail because they require conditions where people can choose freely without fear—and those conditions are precisely what current systems tend to suppress.

Non-coercive change is especially slow. It doesn’t arrive through collapse, conquest, or dramatic victory. It emerges quietly, as people begin to prefer systems that reduce harm, preserve dignity, and don’t require enemies in order to function.

That kind of change doesn’t make for thrilling stories. There are no villains to defeat, no final battles, no moments where everything suddenly turns. There is only gradual alignment, trust earned over time, and the steady replacement of fear with security.

Perhaps the reason we don’t spend all our time pursuing a truly functional system for our planet is not because it’s impossible—but because it asks us to move beyond survival narratives and power struggles into something less familiar: **shared stewardship**.

The hardest part is not imagining a better world.

The hardest part is creating the conditions where choosing it feels safe.
