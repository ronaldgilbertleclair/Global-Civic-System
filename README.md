# Global Civic System

This repository contains a set of documents exploring whether humanity might benefit from thinking together about how shared life could be organized in the modern age.

The work does not propose implementation, enforcement, or immediate change. It exists to support reflection, consideration, and dialogue — made possible by global communication technologies that did not previously exist.

Participation is voluntary.  
Agreement is not required.
